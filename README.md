# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Evelyn Mao, She/her. I'm more interested in story-telling games like Detroit and Read Dead. I enjoy games that are not too competitive and have a slow pace. I also play some Souls-like games in my free time, but I actually don't like to make action games for class. I attended a few GameJams before, but I felt quite disappointed because they were all male-oriented. They all made platform-action games and preferred to let girls be the artists and stay in their positions. That's why I want to learn coding so that I can also have more authority to talk. I

3. To at least be able to make some easy pixel games. I haven't learned to code before, so I hope I can learn some basic knowledge. Even if I won't be a programmer in the future, at least I know whether it's feasible to do something in the field of programming.
4. I actually don't want group projects? Maybe the game jams I attended traumatized me too much (lol). I'm a little nervous about cooperating with my classmates. I wish I can make something out of my own ideas and interests, instead of obeying orders from others.
5. For the past few game jams, I was the 2D artist. I wish I could get a director position in a team, (like providing ideas or come up with good story backgrounds), but I found that some boys have too much passion for games, so I have no chance to talk. I don't even know whether my art ability has improved after those competitions, but I start to get tired of making art like a machine and being rejected by the leader. My coding ability is 0 so far, but I hope I can nail this after this quarter.
